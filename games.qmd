I started making games since the later-half of my sophomore year in college. I have now 8 games published on itch.io, and I'm still making more!

I focus on game design and feature implementation, so I always ask myself

- How can I make [a complicated system/feature] work?
- How can I make the game *easily understood* and *fun*?

Check out some of my most recent games below!
