It was really fun making this game, and I'm really glad I have finally made it to within top 100 with my fourth LD attempt.

## My role

- Implemented all game features, including
  - Hook bounce physics
  - Trajectory calculation and preview
  - Dynamic + responsive multiplier text size
  - UI/UX (menus, buttons, pause page, etc.)
- Gathered player feedback and improved game feel iteratively and rapidly
