    "text": "Results\nBy using univariate T-test, linear regression, logistic regression, and Poisson regression, we have observed the following:\n\nKey to long careers: Longer careers are predicted by lower rates of walks given, higher fastball velocity, and more outs achieved in the first two years of a pitcher’s career.\nInjury risks: Higher cumulative fastball counts over the past 2 games increases the chance of the pitcher getting injured in this game.\nPitch type advantages: Among rookie pitchers, breaking balls lead to more strikeouts, fastballs lead to more walks, and offspeed balls are more likely to get hit a home run\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnivariate T-Test on key statistics between pitchers with short and long career lengths\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLogistic model of risk of injury and rolling pitch counts\n\n\n\n\n\nWith these findings, we suggested that:\n\nInjury prevention: Baseball teams should closely monitor their pitchers’ rolling fastball workload, as sustained stretches of high fastball usage meaningfully increase short-term injury risk.\nPitcher development pan: Early-career development should emphasize sharpening command, since lower walk rates consistently predict longer MLB careers. Improving breaking-ball quality offers the greatest upside for generating strikeouts, while refining offspeed control can directly reduce susceptibility to home runs.\nScouting for future stars: Scouts should prioritize identifying prospects with strong fastball quality, as this pitch is the foundation of pitching success and is the most important pitch in the game.\n\nWe have summarized our findings and recommendations into the presentation slides below."
