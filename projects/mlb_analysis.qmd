## Goal

Given a detailed dataset containing MLB pitchers' performance and injury records from 2010 - 2020, we aimed to analyze them to determine key variables that coaches should look out for when maintaining and improving their players. *Winning a season is not a sprint, but a marathon.* It is crucial to keep players in shape and have high performance whilst minimizing the risk of injury.

## Results

By using **univariate T-test**, **linear regression**, **logistic regression**, and **Poisson regression**, we have observed the following:

- Longer careers are predicted by *lower rates of walks given*, *higher fastball velocity*, and *more outs achieved* in the first two years of a pitcher's career.
- *Higher cumulative fastball* counts over the past 2 games increases the chance of the pitcher getting injured in this game.
- Among rookie pitchers, *breaking balls* lead to more strikeouts, *fastballs* lead to more walks, and *offspeed* balls are more likely to get hit a home run

:::

With these findings, we suggested that:

- Baseball teams should closely monitor their pitchers’ *rolling fastball workload*, as sustained stretches of high fastball usage meaningfully increase short-term injury risk.
- Early-career development should emphasize *sharpening command*, since lower walk rates consistently predict longer MLB careers. Improving breaking-ball quality offers the greatest upside for generating strikeouts, while refining offspeed control can directly reduce susceptibility to home runs.
- Scouts should prioritize identifying prospects with *strong fastball quality*, as this pitch is the foundation of pitching success and is the most important pitch in the game.

We have summarized our findings and recommendations into the presentation slides below.

## What I did

- Data cleaning and wrangling
  - converting character sequences into machine-interpretable columns
  - NA removal
- Exploratory data analysis
- Analysis of the second research question: **Among new pitchers, are there specific pitches
that lead to a higher chance of injury or better performance?**
  - Fit a **logistic regression model** to predict the chance of pitcher injury; achieved AUC of 0.69
  - Fit 4 **Poisson regression models** to examine the most important pitch type associated with each performance metric
- Finding organization and report writing
