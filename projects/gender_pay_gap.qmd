**Using data from 1,945 Irish companies, I modeled how industry, bonus structures, and workforce composition influence gender pay gaps. The analysis identifies key drivers of wider disparities and shows a slight improvement across recent reporting years.**

## Goal

This project develops a predictive model to understand what drives gender pay gaps among large Irish companies following Ireland’s Gender Pay Gap Information Act (2022). Using a dataset of 1,945 company reports from [PayGap.ie](https://paygap.ie/downloads) (2022–2024), we analyzed how factors such as industry, bonus structures, part-time pay gaps, and gender composition relate to differences in mean hourly pay.

## What I did

In this project, I did the following:

- Extracted 10 relevant predictors among 29 other correlated variables.
- Compiled summary statistics for the 10 predictors + outcome variable
- Visualized the distribution of all 11 variables
- Performed best model selection through the following methods
  - Best subset selection
  - Forward selection
  - Backward selection

All three methods indicates that the full model is the best.

## Results

Our final model shows the following factors affect the mean hourly pay gap between male and female in Ireland:

- The year in which the data was collected
- Mean gap in yearly bonus
- Median gap in yearly bonus
- Mean hourly part-time wage
- Percentage of female employees that received a bonus
- Percentage of female employees that received a benefit in kind
- Percentage of female employees

Specifically, the mean gap in hourly wage between the two genders have decreased by .64% on average each year from 2022 to 2024.
