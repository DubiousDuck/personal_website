## Goal

In 48 hours, we need to analyze a rich but messy data set provided by Savills Real Estate and present actionable insights to important stakeholders of the company.

## Results

Our team focused on advising the Real Estate company to invest in properties in emerging hub cities.

Specifically, for the *financial sector*, there is an emerging office hub in *Orange County* due to its proximity to airports and overall better quality of life compared to Los Angeles.

For the *tech sector*, there is an emerging office hub in *San Jose* due to the decreasing land lease space since COVID as well as improving living conditions compared to San Francisco.

In sum, we advised the company to focus on **attracting finance companies to Orange County and tech companies to San Jose** to meet the trend for maximum success.

Our creative insights and energetic presentation won us the **Judge's Choice Award** out of 80 other competing teams.

## What I did

- Data cleaning and Exploratory Data Analysis
- GIS plotting of office locations on Google Map with Geopandas
- Graphing amenity growth comparison between San Jose and San Francisco
- Presenting our findings clearly and concisely to non-technical audience
