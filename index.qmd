Hello! I'm Oscar. I love asking questions, finding ways to answer them, and using the insights to create cool tools and experiences. I do research, build tools to make others' works easier, and design/program video games that my friends love to play. With everything I do, I strive to make it fun, impactful, and memorable.

Check out my projects and games from the menu bar or get in touch with me through the platforms below!
