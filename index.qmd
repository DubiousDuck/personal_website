Hello! I'm Oscar. I like to ask questions, answer them, and use what I found to create cool tools and experiences. I do research, build tools to make others' works easier, and design/program video games for my friends to play. With everything I do, I strive to make it fun, impactful, and memorable.

Check out my projects and games from the menu bar or get in touch with me through the platforms below!
